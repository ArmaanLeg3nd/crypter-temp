# crypter-temp
A crypter written in python which utilizes AES-GCM
### This tool is for educational purposes only

This crypter utilizes the AES-GCM (Galois Counter Mode) since it takes any amount of data as input and is also fast during decryption and a crypter usually encrypts the code once and it is expected the malicious code decryption should be as efficient as possible.
